## Problem
Describe the accounting or finance workflow challenge this recipe solves and the business context.

## Solution (at a glance)
1. Summarize the high-level steps (3â€“5 bullets) the practitioner follows.
2. Keep actions in verb-first voice (e.g., "Ingest trial balance").
3. Call out where GenAI is used versus deterministic logic.

## Prompt
```text
<Provide the production-ready prompt or prompt outline.>
<Include any required context blocks, examples, or tool instructions.>
<Show the expected format of the model's response.>
```

## Guardrails
- List data-handling, compliance, and review requirements.
- Note model limitations and fallback paths for low-confidence outputs.
- Reference any policies (SOX, PCAOB, HIPAA, etc.) that apply.

## Implementation Notes (optional)
- Capture key configuration details, API parameters, or scripts.
- Link to assets under `code/` or `data/` if provided.

## Evaluation & Handoff (optional)
- Outline how to validate results (spot checks, reconciliations, sign-off).
- Mention downstream systems or teams that consume the output.

## Checklist
- [ ] Sample data or walkthrough validated end-to-end
- [ ] Edge cases and failure modes documented
- [ ] Demo video link added
- [ ] Prompt updated with organization-specific terms (optional)
