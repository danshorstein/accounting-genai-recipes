## How to add a recipe
1. Create a new folder in `recipes/` using `kebab-case` (e.g., `03-bank-reconciliation`).
2. Copy `templates/recipe.md` into your new folder and fill out the metadata.
3. Keep examples anonymized and safe—**no PII/PHI/PCI**. Redact customer data.
4. Link a short video demo (2–5 min). Prefer YouTube (unlisted) links.
5. Submit a PR with:
   - A meaningful title (e.g., `feat(recipe): bank reconciliation`)
   - A **preview image** (PNG) under the recipe folder for the docs index.
   - Passing CI checks (markdown lint, link check).

## Style
- Use present tense and active voice.
- Keep steps numbered and concise.
- Prompts in fenced blocks with language hints, e.g., ```text

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and constructive. No confidential data or client secrets.
